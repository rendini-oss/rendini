We’re building the a collection of "Rendini" web rendering APIs including the
"Rendini Render API" and "Rendini Maship API" to enable AI-first web rendering
of component graphs. When possible, individual lines should wrap at less than
80 characters in length. All content should prefer the words "render" and
"rendering" over "renderer" as well as the word "renders" over "renderers".
All new source files must begin with an SPDX header matching our LICENSE
(Apache-2.0) and include Copyright (c) [year] Rendini Labs. All GraphQL schemas
must follow our versioned-by-major-version pattern (v1, v2, …). Our general
code style: follows EditorConfig with Prettier. Our TypeScript code style:
double-quotes, 2-space indents, and JSDoc comments on every exported function.
