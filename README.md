# Rendini

> **Rendini** is a next‚Äëgeneration **web rendering‚Äëas‚Äëa‚Äëservice platform**, unifying how web
> applications, pages, and "components" are discovered, composed, and rendered across build‚Äëtime,
> server‚Äëside, and client‚Äëside lifecycles‚Äîindependent of framework or deployment target.

---

## üåü Project Overview

Rendini‚Äôs mission is to make rendering **portable, predictable, and performant**:

| Challenge                                     | Rendini Solution                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mixed tech stacks (React, Vue, Svelte‚Ä¶)       | Framework‚Äëagnostic component contracts & pluggable render strategies |
| Multiple render moments (build, edge, client) | Declarative ‚Äúrender anywhere‚Äù lifecycle                              |
| Slow iteration, fragmented infra              | Single registry + API for discovery, composition, and delivery       |

> **Status (Œ±‚Äëpreview)** ‚Äì Active R&D. Core spec drafts, APIs, and proofs‚Äëof‚Äëtechnology (PoTs) are
> evolving rapidly. See the [Roadmap](#-roadmap).

## üöß Proof‚Äëof‚ÄëTechnology (PoT): Render Nunjucks

The **Rendini Render Nunjucks** demonstrates:

- Automatic discovery of `*.njk` page templates in `src/pages/`
- REST and GraphQL endpoints for listing and rendering pages
- Container & Kubernetes deployment workflow

It is **not** the full Rendini platform‚Äîjust the first stepping stone.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Install [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for source control.
- Install [`gh`, the GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), for GitHub interactions.
- Install tooling that supports `docker` and `docker compose` for containers. Examples:
  - Servers and some operating systems can simply install these as utility middleware tools without
    a "Desktop" bundled installation.
  - [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/)
  - [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/)
  - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) _\*May require a paid license
    in many circumstances._
- Install [`tilt` for container orchestration](https://tilt.dev/install)
- Install [GNU `make` for command simplification](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) _\*Windows
  users see note._

> [!TIP] Windows with Git BASH
>
> Windows users are encouraged to use ["Git for Windows"](https://gitforwindows.org/) with Git BASH
> and the emulated Mintty, POSIX-compatible terminal. After installing Git BASH, install GNU `make`
> support by following [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66525071) (review the guide's
> comments). This ensures "enough" consistency with \*nix and macOS platforms. While it may be
> possible to use other `make` alternatives on Windows, this Git BASH integration is the currently
> known and supported solution. After installing, the path to `make` (e.g. C:\Program
> Files\Git\mingw64\bin\make.exe) must either be registered on the system "PATH" environment
> variable or it can be entered into the settings for the VS Code extension "Makefile Tools" under
> the "Makefile: Make Path" setting for the user. _\*This system-specific path should not be set as
> a workspace setting for this project._

### Running Rendini

In the future, explicit "Contributor" steps will be separated from how to use Rendini.

1. Open a POSIX-compatible terminal.
2. Navigate to a file system directory to store the Rendini project code.
3. Execute the following commands:

```bash
gh repo clone rendini-oss/rendini -- --depth=1
# Or...
# git clone https://github.com/rendini-oss/rendini.git --depth=1
cd rendini
make # Install the system.
# Or...
# make dev # Start the system.
```

#### Running Rendini in VS Code

1. Open a blank project window and the terminal.
2. Navigate to a file system directory to store the Rendini project code.
3. Clone the repository with the command `gh repo clone rendini-oss/rendini -- --depth=1`
4. Install the recommended extensions.
5. Build Rendini with several options:
   - Use the VS Code keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Windows
     or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on macOS to build.
   - Use the command `make`.
   - Open the VS Code command pallette and run the command "Makefile: Clean and build the target
     ALL".
6. Start Rendini with the command `make dev`.
7. Review the "./makefile" used by GNU `make` targets to better understand and triage native command
   interactions run by developers and automation servers (e.g. Continuous Integration on GitHub
   Actions).
8. Review the "./tiltfile" (and loaded extensions) used by `tilt` to better understand and triage
   native command and container orchestration run by developers and automation servers (e.g.
   Continuous Integration on GitHub Actions).

## üõ† REST API

- **List templates**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/render-targets
```

- **Render a template**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/render \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"home","data":{"user":"World"}}'
```

---

## üîé GraphQL API

Rendini provides a GraphQL API with GraphiQL interface for easier exploration and testing.

- **Endpoint**

```text
GET/POST /graphql
```

- **GraphiQL Interface**

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/graphiql` in your browser to use the interactive GraphiQL
interface.

- **Sample Query**

```graphql
query {
  renderTargets {
    name
    template
  }
}
```

- **Sample Mutation**

```graphql
mutation {
  render(name: "about", data: { team: "Engineering" }) {
    html
  }
}
```
