# Project Governance

This document outlines how the Rendini project is governed.

## Project Stewardship Model

Rendini is currently maintained by a core team of maintainers who set the roadmap, review and merge
contributions, and ensure the project's quality and direction.

### Current Maintainers

The current maintainer(s) of Rendini are:

- Rendini Open Source Team

### Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for:

- Setting the project's roadmap and vision
- Reviewing and merging contributions
- Releasing new versions
- Maintaining the project's codebase, documentation, and infrastructure
- Making decisions about project features and direction
- Ensuring the project adheres to its quality standards and values

## Community Participation

### How to Propose Changes

Community members can propose changes to Rendini through:

1. **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests, and general discussions should start as GitHub
   issues. Use the appropriate issue template if available.

2. **Pull Requests**: Code contributions should be submitted as pull requests. Please ensure your
   PR:

   - References an existing issue
   - Includes tests for new functionality
   - Follows the project's coding standards
   - Has a clear description of the changes

3. **Request for Comments (RFCs)**: For significant changes or those that impact the project's
   architecture or public APIs, we encourage submitting an RFC in the form of a GitHub issue labeled
   "RFC". RFCs should include:
   - A detailed description of the proposed change
   - Motivation and rationale
   - Implementation details
   - Alternatives considered
   - Impact on existing functionality

### Decision Making Process

Decisions about the project are made through:

1. **Consensus**: For most changes, we seek consensus among maintainers.
2. **Maintainer Approval**: Pull requests require approval from at least one maintainer before
   merging.
3. **Final Authority**: In cases where consensus cannot be reached, the lead maintainer has the
   final decision-making authority.

## Evolution of Governance

As the project grows, our governance model will evolve:

### Future Governance Structure

Once the project has:

- At least 3 active external maintainers from different organizations
- A consistent community of contributors
- Regular releases and stable usage

We plan to implement:

1. **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)**: A formal committee of 5-7 members that will:

   - Guide the project's technical direction
   - Approve architectural changes
   - Mentor new contributors
   - Oversee the project's governance

2. **Formal Voting Process**: For major decisions, a formal voting process will be established
   where:

   - Proposals will be documented and shared
   - TSC members will have voting rights
   - Decisions will require a two-thirds majority
   - Votes will be recorded publicly

3. **Special Interest Groups (SIGs)**: As the project scope expands, we may form focused SIGs to
   oversee specific areas of the project.

### How to Become a Maintainer

Community members who have demonstrated sustained commitment to the project may be invited to become
maintainers. The criteria include:

- Consistent, high-quality contributions over time
- Understanding of the project's codebase and values
- Constructive participation in discussions
- Mentoring other contributors
- Alignment with the project's vision

Current maintainers will nominate and approve new maintainers based on these criteria.

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the Rendini community are expected to follow our
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/link-to-code-of-conduct).

## Changes to Governance

Changes to this governance document must be approved by the current maintainers. Proposals for
changes should be submitted as pull requests with a clear rationale for the proposed changes.
