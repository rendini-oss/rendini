# Trademark Policy

This document outlines the trademark policy for the Rendini project.

## Trademark Ownership

"Rendini" is a registered trademark of Rendini Open Source. The Rendini name and any associated logos are exclusive property of Rendini Open Source and are protected by trademark laws.

## Usage Policy

While the Rendini project's code is available under the Apache License 2.0, the use of the "Rendini" name and logos is subject to this trademark policy.

### Permitted Uses

You may:

1. **Reference the Project**: Use the Rendini name in a factual manner to refer to the project itself, provided that such use does not imply endorsement by or affiliation with Rendini Open Source.

2. **Unmodified Distribution**: Distribute unmodified copies of the official Rendini software, including binary distributions, provided that you do not use the Rendini name or logo as part of a product or service name.

### Restricted Uses

You may not:

1. **Create Modified Products**: Use the Rendini name or logo to identify modified versions of the software. Forks or derivative works must use different names and logos.

2. **Imply Endorsement**: Use the Rendini name or logo in a way that suggests an official status or implies endorsement by Rendini Open Source.

3. **Create Confusion**: Use the Rendini name or logo in a way that would cause confusion about the origin of software or services.

4. **Domain Names**: Register or use domain names containing the Rendini name without express written permission from Rendini Open Source.

### Requirements for Forks

If you create a fork or derivative work of Rendini, you must:

1. **Rebrand**: Choose a different name and logo that is not confusingly similar to "Rendini".

2. **Attribution**: Provide appropriate attribution to the original Rendini project.

3. **Distinction**: Clearly communicate to users that your project is a fork and not the original Rendini project.

## Proper Trademark Use

When referencing the Rendini trademark:

1. Use the trademark as an adjective, not a noun or verb (e.g., "Rendini software" not just "Rendini").

2. Do not alter, animate, or otherwise modify the Rendini logo.

3. Maintain appropriate visual distinction between your content and the Rendini trademarks.

## Enforcement

Rendini Open Source reserves the right to enforce its trademark rights. Unauthorized use may result in legal action. We prefer to resolve trademark issues amicably and ask that you contact us with any questions about appropriate usage.

## Requesting Permission

For uses not explicitly permitted by this policy, please contact Rendini Open Source to request permission.

## Changes to This Policy

Rendini Open Source reserves the right to modify this trademark policy at any time. Changes will be effective upon posting the revised policy to the project repository.
